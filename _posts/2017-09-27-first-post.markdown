What's up internet!

Trying to learn jekyll and github on the fly is proving to be quite fun. I should be trudging through C++ code to complete my Advanced
Graphics and Game Engine Design project; however, web development has always been my favorite programming area.... so here we are. 

I've been meaning to get a personal website up and running for quite some time, and this site will serve as my own personal resume site and
playground for testing my web development talent. 

While the website's main purpose is to develop and display my programming skills, I am not entirely sure what I will do with this blog
going forward. I will probably use the blog as quasi-documentation to describe the changes to the site, to explore future changes to the 
website, and to detail other projects I may be working on.

See ya later, Internet!
